# Eden-Svelte-Query

Eden-Svelte-Query offers a first class integration with Svelte.
Under the hood this is simply a wrapper around the very popular [@tanstack/svelte-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest),
so we recommend that you familiarise yourself with Svelte Query,
as their docs go in to much greater depth on its usage.

:::tip
If you are using SvelteKit we recommend using [our integration with that](../sveltekit) instead

(WIP)
:::

:::note
Svelte code-snippets may have an empty `<script lang="ts" context="module">` block
or equivalent that is used to include other snippets through twoslash.

Unless stated otherwise, assume that the code sample will work function the exact same
without this extra block.

### The Eden Svelte Query Integration

This library enables usage directly within Svelte components

#### Elysia Server Application

<Server />

#### Eden-Query Client

<Client />


```svelte twoslash title=+page.svelte
<script lang="ts" module>
  // @filename: eden.ts
  // @include: apps-svelte-client-1

  // @filename: page.ts
  // ---cut---
</script>

<script lang="ts">
  import { eden } from './eden'

  const query = eden.index.get.createQuery()
  const mutation = eden.id({ id: "Bob" }).post.createMutation()
</script>

<div>
  <p>Query: {$query.data}</p>
  <button on:click={() => $mutation.mutate({ id: "B", name: "Bob" })}>Mutation</button>
</div>

```

### Differences to vanilla Svelte Query

The wrapper abstracts some aspects of Svelte Query for you:

- Query Keys - these are generated and managed by eden on your behalf, based on the procedure inputs you provide.
  - If you need the query key which eden calculates, you can use [getQueryKey](./getQueryKey).
- Type safe by default - the types you provide in your Elysia Backend also drive the types of your Svelte Query client,
  providing safety throughout your Svelte app.
