# Introduction

Eden-Query is a type-safe, API client for [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com) that provides
asynchronous state management with [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).

<Integration />

The Eden-Query project is a collection of libraries that includes the RPC client, [`@ap0nia/eden`](/eden),
and framework-specific integrations, such as [`@ap0nia/eden-react-query`](/eden-query/react) and
[`@ap0nia/eden-svelte-query`](/eden-query/svelte) for React and Svelte respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> The [`@ap0nia/eden`](/eden) library is a distinct, but functionally identical implementation of the
> official [`@elysiajs/eden`](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview.html) library.

## Why

Eden-Query is most valuable to ***frontend projects that connect to an Elysia.js backend***.
The Elysia.js types may be exposed from a separate project within a monorepo, or within a
single project that leverages a full-stack solution such as Next.js or SvelteKit.

See the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/ap0nia/eden-query/tree/main/examples) for examples.

## Related Projects

### [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

tRPC is a type-safe, full-stack integration that allows developers to easily types
between their frontend and backend without code generation.

The core architecture and public API of Eden-Query was inspired by tRPC, making transitions
between the two libraries feel seamless.
