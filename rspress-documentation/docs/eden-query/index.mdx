# Introduction

Eden-Query is a type-safe, API client for [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com) that provides
asynchronous state management with [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).

<Integration />

The Eden-Query project is a collection of libraries that includes the RPC client, [`@ap0nia/eden`](/eden),
and framework-specific integrations, such as [`@ap0nia/eden-react-query`](/eden-query/react) and
[`@ap0nia/eden-svelte-query`](/eden-query/svelte) for React and Svelte respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> The [`@ap0nia/eden`](/eden) library is a distinct, but functionally identical implementation of the
> official [`@elysiajs/eden`](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview.html) library.

## Why

Eden-Query is most valuable to ***frontend projects that connect to an Elysia.js backend***.
The Elysia.js types may be exposed from a separate project within a monorepo, or within a
single project that leverages a full-stack solution such as Next.js or SvelteKit.

See the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/ap0nia/eden-query/tree/main/examples) for examples.

## Features

- üåé Framework agnostic.
- ü¶∫ Full end-to-end type-safety.
- ‚úÖ Fully supports REST API standards.
- üñ•Ô∏èSSR support and examples.
- ‚ú® Reactive and infinite queries.
- ‚ö° Batching requests on both the client and server.
- üîó Links for customizing the flow of data.
- üëÄ Data transformers for enhanced JSON handling.

## Implementations

Eden-Query offers two implementations, [fetch](#fetch) and [treaty](#treaty),
just like the official eden library.

### Fetch (WIP)

- Tanstack-query hooks are exposed at the root of the proxy.
- The full path to the route is provided as the first argument.
- Input to the route, such as query and route parameters, are provided after the path.

:::warning
This has not been implemented for any framework yet...
:::

### Treaty

- API routes are split by their path segments, and represented as a nested object.
- `/api/a/b` -> `eden.api.a.b`.
- The method and hook are provided as the last two property accesses.
- `eden.api.a.b.get.createQuery` -> `createQuery` for `GET` request to `/api/a/b`.

#### Example Application

```typescript twoslash include eq-index-application title="server.ts"
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
  .get('/nendoroid/:id/name', () => {
    return 'Skadi'
  })
  .put(
    '/nendoroid/:id',
    (context) => {
      return { status: 'OK', received: context.body }
    },
    {
      body: t.Object({
        name: t.String(),
        from: t.String(),
      }),
    },
  )
  .listen(3000)

export type App = typeof app
```


#### Example React-Query Usage

A React client application cna use the hooks from Eden-Query to manage asynchronous state from the Elysia server application.

::: code-group

```typescript twoslash [index.ts]
// @filename: server.ts
// @include: eq-index-application

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { createEdenTreatyReactQuery } from '@ap0nia/eden-react-query'
import type { App } from './server'

/**
 * The domain is usually needed if the client application
 * is not part of a full stack framework.
 *
 * For example, a React single-page-application would need to specify
 * the server domain, while a Next.js application would not.
 *
 * Follow the steps provided in the specific framework integration.
 */
const domain = 'localhost:3000'

export const app = createEdenTreatyReactQuery<App>({ domain })

// useQuery for [GET] request to '/nendoroid/:id/name'
const { data } = await app.nendoroid({ id: 'skadi' }).name.get.useQuery()

// useMutation for [PUT] request to '/nendoroid/:id'
const { data: nendoroid, error, mutateAsync } = app.nendoroid({ id: 1895 }).put.useMutation()

// Peform the mutation...
mutateAsync({ name: 'Skadi', from: 'Arknights' }).then((result) => {
  result
  // ^?
})
```

:::

::: tip
`useMutation` does not actually perform the request.
The result of `useMutation` has `mutate` and `mutateAsync` methods that receive the input to make the request.

[Read more about mutations here](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useMutation#usemutation)
:::

## Comparison with tRPC

### Links

This library supports the same type of [links that tRPC has](https://trpc.io/docs/client/links).

The official eden library only resolves requests, so Eden-Query provides helper methods to
quickly initialize a client that does the same.

Read more about Eden-Query links [here](./links).

#### eden.createHttpClient

This creates a basic eden client that resolves requests in the same way as the official eden implementation.

```typescript twoslash
import { createEdenTreatyReactQuery, httpLink } from '@ap0nia/eden-react-query'

const eden = createEdenTreatyReactQuery()

const domain = 'http://localhost:3000'

// Both are the exact same clients.

const clientOne = eden.createClient({
  links: [httpLink({ domain })],
})

const clientTwo = eden.createHttpClient({ domain })
```

::: tip
Using this helper method means you don't have to initialize an `httpLink` from scratch,
and you can provide `HTTPLinkOptions` directly to the method to create the client.
:::

#### eden.createHttpBatchClient

Creates a client that can combine multiple requests into a single batch request.

:::warning
In order for this client to work properly, the Elysia server application must use the `batchPlugin`
or `edenPlugin` with the `batch` property defined.
:::

**Elysia.js application with batching enabled**

::: code-group

```typescript twoslash include eq-index-batch-application [server.ts]
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'
import { edenPlugin } from '@ap0nia/eden-react-query/server'

const app = new Elysia().use(edenPlugin({ batch: true }))

export type App = typeof app
```

:::

**React-Query Batch Client**

::: code-group

```typescript twoslash [index.ts]
// @filename: server.ts
// @include: eq-index-batch-application

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { createEdenTreatyReactQuery, httpBatchLink } from '@ap0nia/eden-react-query'
import type { App } from './server'

const eden = createEdenTreatyReactQuery<App>()

const domain = 'http://localhost:3000'

// Both are the exact same clients.

const clientOne = eden.createClient({
  links: [httpBatchLink({ domain, endpoint: '/api/batch' })],
})

const clientTwo = eden.createHttpBatchClient({ domain })
```

:::

### Transformers

This library supports the [same transformer API as tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs/server/data-transformers).

:::info
The transformers will only modify `request.body`.
So this will **NOT** affect GET, OPTIONS, or HEAD requests; only POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.
:::

## Related Projects

### [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

tRPC is a type-safe, full-stack integration that allows developers to easily types
between their frontend and backend without code generation.

The core architecture and public API of Eden-Query was inspired by tRPC, making transitions
between the two libraries feel seamless.

Some documentation may link to this project to provide additional information and context.
